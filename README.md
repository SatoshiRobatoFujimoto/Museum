In this project, [KodeLife] and [Unity] are cooperatively used to create
audio-reactive visuals in an improvisational way.

The editing process of live coding in KodeLife is shared with Unity in real
time by using the [Spout] framework. This set make it easier to combine
improvised visuals and prepared scenes/props.

This project is rather cluttered and not well-organized. I don't expect this to
be useful for anyone but myself.
